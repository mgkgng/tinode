"""Candidate Select — pick one candidate out of a generated batch.

Step 1 renders N candidates from consecutive seeds and you choose one. Core's
Latent From Batch can slice the batch, but it only hands back a latent: it does
not tell you WHICH seed you just chose, and a seed is the whole identity of a
candidate — the thing you write down, re-run months later, or send to someone
else. This node returns the latent, its preview, and that seed together.

The seed arithmetic mirrors Seed Range Noise: candidate i was drawn from
`origin_seed + i`, so selecting index i reports `origin_seed + i`. Wire the same
seed that fed the noise node and the number that comes out is directly re-usable
in any stock workflow.

Both of a sampler's latent outputs can be sliced at once: pass `denoised` too
and the same index comes back on both. That is what lets a chosen candidate be
branched again — Noise Rotate needs the pair, and one ◀ ▶ choice should not have
to be repeated on a second node that could drift out of step with this one.

`batch_index` is stamped on the emitted latent, exactly as Latent From Batch
does. Nothing downstream needs it while a continuation runs on DisableNoise, but
the moment noise IS regenerated from this latent, that stamp is what keeps the
candidate on its own seed instead of silently sliding to another.

The widget has two views. The GRID shows every candidate at once, for the
comparison the choice actually is; clicking one selects it and opens the SINGLE
view, which shows that candidate large — a thumbnail is enough to tell two
compositions apart, never enough to judge one. The single view carries ◀ ▶ so
the batch can be walked at full size, and those buttons move the selection with
the view: a cursor that pointed somewhere other than `index` would be this
project's founding bug in miniature, a picture that has moved while the number
under it has not.

Index is 0-based on the wire and 1-based in the readout — matching Item Cursor,
and keeping `seed = origin_seed + index` free of an off-by-one. Out-of-range
clamps rather than raising, because a cursor that refuses to move is worse than
one that stops at the end, and the readout always shows where you actually are.

# Two sizes per candidate. The grid draws 56px tiles, so a tile that arrived at
# full resolution would cost megabytes per run to render a stamp; the single view
# is a real look at the picture and 320px would be a blurry insult. Publishing
# both keeps the grid cheap AND the inspection honest, because the browser only
# fetches a full image for the ONE candidate actually being viewed.
