"""Stamp Step / Resume Step — let a partial latent say where it is.

A latent that has been sampled part-way is meaningless without the sigma it sits
at. Everything else in this pack takes that seriously; the graph did not. A
staged workflow carries the position on a SEPARATE wire — the stage's checkpoint
widget — while the latent itself says nothing. Two facts, two places, free to
disagree.

They disagree the moment a stage is skipped. Bypass Step C and ComfyUI passes
the latent through correctly (the bypass rule matches inputs to outputs by slot
position), so the FINAL stage receives Step B's latent — but its `start_step` is
still wired to Checkpoint C. The sampler is told the latent holds 34% noise when
it holds 69%, under-denoises, and returns a soft, still-noisy image with no
error anywhere. Nothing is broken enough to complain.

A stamp fixes that by making the latent self-describing.

WHAT A STAMP IS
---------------
A ComfyUI LATENT is a plain dict: `{"samples": tensor}` plus whatever else rides
along. Core already does this — `batch_index` from Latent From Batch,
`noise_mask` from the inpaint nodes — and every node that passes a latent on
rebuilds it with `latent.copy()`, so extra keys survive untouched. Verified for
the whole chain this pack uses: SamplerCustomAdvanced (nodes_custom_sampler.py,
`out = latent.copy()`), Candidate Select, and Noise Rotate.

So stamping is just:

    latent["ti_step"] = 11

The number travels WITH the tensor it describes, the way EXIF travels with a
photo, instead of alongside it on a wire that can be rerouted, bypassed or left
pointing at the wrong stage. It cannot get out of sync, because there is only
one copy of the fact.

WHY THIS BEATS A SWITCH
-----------------------
The obvious fix is a switch that picks the right checkpoint number depending on
which stages are enabled. That works, but it means the graph encodes the
enabled-stage set twice — once in the bypass state, once in the switch wiring —
and those two can drift apart.

A stamp needs no such knowledge. Bypass a stage and its Stamp Step goes with it,
so the latent arrives still carrying whichever stage last actually ran, and the
next stage reads the truth. Correct for every combination of enabled stages,
including ones nobody planned for: skipping the middle stage becomes a valid
two-branch tree rather than a silent mis-render.

USE
---
    end of a stage:    sampler output -> Stamp Step (step = this stage's end)
    start of a stage:  incoming latent -> Resume Step -> Sigma Segment.start_step

`end_step` still comes from the stage's own control. Only `start_step` is read
from the latent, because only the latent knows where it actually is.
