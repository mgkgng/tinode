"""Noise Rotate — controlled descendants of a partial latent.

You stopped a generation part-way, looked at it, and want to see several ways it
could still go. A partial latent splits into what the model has already decided
and what is still undecided:

    x  =  x0_pred  +  residual

`x0_pred` is the model's current guess at the finished image — the part you
picked. The residual is the noise it has not resolved yet, and that is where the
remaining freedom lives. So: keep x0_pred, and turn the residual toward a
different answer.

    eps     = x - x0_pred
    new     = randn(variation_seed) * eps.std()
    eps_var = cos(theta) * eps + sin(theta) * new
    variant = x0_pred + eps_var

Rotating rather than adding is the whole point. `x + d*eps'` inflates the noise
level (by sqrt(1+d^2)), so the continuation would run a schedule that expects
less noise than it gets and quietly under-denoise — variation strength and
quality loss confounded in one dial. Because cos^2 + sin^2 = 1, this leaves
||x - x0_pred|| exactly unchanged: theta moves the direction, never the amount.
Scaling `new` to the residual's OWN magnitude rather than assuming a unit
variance is what keeps that true at any checkpoint, and means the node needs
neither sigma nor a latent-space conversion.

theta is an angle, and it is exactly the cosine similarity between the old
residual and the new one: cos_sim(eps, eps_var) = cos(theta). That identity holds
because `new` is drawn independently of `eps`, and two independent gaussians in
D dimensions are near-orthogonal (cos ~ 1/sqrt(D), about 0.6% at 4x113x64). So
the number on the widget is the angle actually turned, to within a fraction of a
degree — and it gets more exact at higher resolution, not less.

    theta = 0    exact continuation (the control)
    10-45        the useful working range
    90           fresh direction at the same noise level, x0_pred still kept

theta steers TWO things at once, and they are not the same number. The angle
from the parent is theta. The angle between two SIBLINGS is wider — at the
default spread of 90:

    angle(variant_i, variant_j) = acos(cos^2 theta)

    theta:           0    10     30     45     60     90    120    150    180
    from parent:   0.0  10.1   30.2   45.3   60.2   90.0  119.8  149.8  180.0
    between sibs:  0.0  14.3   41.8   60.4   75.9   90.4   76.0   41.8    0.0

Siblings are always further from each other than from the parent, and their
spread PEAKS at 90 and then closes again. That is the real reason 90 is the
working maximum: past it the descendants keep marching away from the parent
while collapsing back together, and at 180 the term sin(theta)*new vanishes
entirely — `variation_seed` stops mattering, every descendant is the same
image, and that image is x0_pred minus the residual, the exact negative of the
continuation. At 360 you are back at the original. Values beyond 90 are allowed
because they are interesting to look at, not because they produce more variety.

`spread` separates those two distances. Without it, how different the children
are from EACH OTHER is locked to how far they are from the parent, and there is
no way to ask for "move somewhere new, but keep this family tight". With it,
every child still sits exactly theta from the parent while spread decides how
widely they fan out around a shared family direction:

    spread ->       0      10      20      30      45      60      75      90
    theta  25      0.0     5.9    11.7    17.2    24.4    30.0    33.6    34.8
    theta  45      0.0    10.0    19.7    29.0    41.4    51.3    57.8    60.0
    theta  60      0.0    12.2    24.2    35.7    51.3    64.1    72.5    75.5
                                    (sibling angle in degrees)

spread = 90 is exactly what this node did before it existed, which is why it is
the default. spread = 0 collapses the family to one image repeated `count`
times. Above 90 is a mirror (100 behaves as 80), so the range stops there —
unlike theta, where past 90 is genuinely different.

Note the ceiling is set by theta: spread can only distribute the room theta has
opened. At theta 25 the children can never be more than 34.8 degrees apart.

Negative angles are a free extra axis: cos is even and sin is odd, so -theta has
the identical strength as +theta but is a different descendant.

The node prints what each branch had to work with. Two very different failures
look identical on the canvas -- descendants that come out the same -- and only
the numbers separate them: either the residual barely matters any more (the
model has committed, nothing left to turn) or the latents WERE separated and
the model collapsed them on the way to an image. Distilled/turbo models do the
second: they are trained to jump to their answer and to ignore the noise they
are handed, which is exactly the property this node needs.

SD1.5 reference, "normal" scheduler, 12 total steps, measured on this pack:

    branch at step:      2      4      6      9     11
    residual share:  97.7%  89.3%  71.5%  21.6%   0.1%

These are an EPS-PREDICTION model and do NOT transfer to rectified flow. SD1.5
adds noise with an unbounded sigma so the share runs to ~100%; krea2/Flux mix it
in, so the share cannot exceed roughly 50% however noisy the state is. Read the
share against other checkpoints of the SAME model, never another model's table.

## Which vector gets rotated depends on the model

`x - x0` is the noise ONLY for additive models (x = x0 + sigma*eps). A mixture
model -- rectified flow: Flux, SD3, krea -- builds its state as
x = (1-sigma)*x0 + sigma*eps, so that same subtraction yields sigma*(eps - x0),
noise AND signal together. Rotating it drags the signal off the trajectory:
measured at theta 90, the x0 component came back at 1.00 where 0.125 was valid,
and the implied noise at 3.5x what the schedule expects. The sampler then
resumes on a state that is not on its path and cannot clean it, so the branch
renders as a slightly-perturbed version of where it started rather than
developing. No error anywhere -- the same silent shape as the stamp bug.

Wire `model` + `current_sigma` and the node stops guessing. It asks the model
how IT builds a noisy state, inverts that, rotates the recovered noise, and
lets the model rebuild -- all in sampler space, because Flux's latent format
shifts as well as scales (0.1159) and a rotation performed in the shifted space
would not preserve the offset.

    process_latent_in                -> sampler space
    S = f(sigma, 0, x0)              -> the state with no noise in it
    G = f(sigma, 1, x0) - S          -> the gain on unit noise (NOT sigma:
                                        CONST applies an extra noise_scale)
    eps = (x - S) / G                -> the model's own noise coordinate
    rotate eps                       -> unchanged, this part was always right
    f(sigma, eps')                   -> a valid state at the same sigma
    process_latent_out

There is no list of model names in this file and there must never be one. The
contract is a capability, not an identity: if the model's noise mapping is
affine and non-singular, the node can recover a noise coordinate, vary it and
rebuild; otherwise it refuses and says which guarantee failed. Affinity is
verified with a random probe rather than assumed -- a map can be exactly linear
at 0, 1 and 2 while curved everywhere else, and would otherwise pass with the
right gain.

`model` and `current_sigma` are a PAIR. Half-wired raises, because the fallback
is correct for additive models and wrong for flow, and choosing it silently is
the whole bug.

Measured on SD1.5: branch LATE. At sigma 4.86 (96% noise) x0_pred is barely
committed, so rotating re-rolls the composition rather than varying it. Deeper in
(sigma ~1.8 or below) the layout holds while the interpretation changes, which is
what "show me alternatives" actually means.

`keep_parent` answers a different question from either dial: "this state is
already good — continue it, but show me alternatives too". Every descendant sits
at the SAME theta from the parent, so a family cannot contain both the faithful
continuation and variations of it; two children each theta from the parent can
differ by at most 2*theta, which is why theta=0 makes them all identical no
matter what spread says. That is a fact about distances, not about this code.
`keep_parent` sidesteps it by letting ONE child sit at a different distance —
zero — instead of trying to make zero-distance children differ. Descendant 1 is
then the parent's own continuation, bit-exact, sharing a batch with its
alternatives so they can be judged against each other rather than from memory.

It REPLACES the first descendant instead of prepending one, so descendants
2..count keep the seeds and indices they had with the toggle off.

Variant i uses `variation_seed + i`, and the shared family direction is derived
from the same integer — so one number still addresses the whole set. Note the
pair (variation_seed, index) is what identifies a descendant, not a seed on its
own: because the family direction is shared, a solo run at `variation_seed + i`
builds a DIFFERENT family. Child i is stable under changing `count`, which is
what makes the index a durable address. Reproducing a descendant needs the
parent latent and theta regardless, so a standalone seed never sufficed here.
