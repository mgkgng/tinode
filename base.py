"""Base class for tinode nodes.

ComfyUI does not require a base class — it duck-types on INPUT_TYPES,
RETURN_TYPES and FUNCTION. This base just supplies sane defaults so each
node file stays small, and gives one place to add shared helpers later
(logging, error wrapping, common type constants, etc.).
